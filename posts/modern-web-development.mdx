- **Server-side rendering** for faster initial page loads

## The Rise of Edge Computing

Edge computing is bringing computation closer to users, resulting in:

- Reduced latency
- Better user experience
- More efficient resource utilization

## Conclusion

The future of web development looks bright, with new technologies making it easier to build fast, accessible, and user-friendly applications.
