## Angular: The Full Framework

Angular provides everything you need out of the box:

- **Complete solution** with routing, forms, HTTP client
- **TypeScript by default** for better code quality

- **Enterprise-ready** with strong conventions

### Pros

The best framework is the one that fits your project requirements and team expertise.
