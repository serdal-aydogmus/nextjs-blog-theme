CSS Grid and Flexbox are two powerful layout systems that have revolutionized how we approach web design. But when should you use which? Let's break it down.

## Understanding the Fundamentals

### Flexbox: One-Dimensional Layout
Flexbox is designed for **one-dimensional layouts** - either in a row or a column. It excels at:

- Distributing space along a single axis
- Aligning items within a container
- Creating responsive navigation bars
- Centering content vertically and horizontally

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### CSS Grid: Two-Dimensional Layout
CSS Grid handles **two-dimensional layouts** - rows and columns simultaneously. It's perfect for:

- Creating complex page layouts
- Building card-based designs
- Managing both rows and columns
- Creating responsive grids without media queries

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```

## When to Use Flexbox

Use Flexbox when you need to:

1. **Align items in a single direction**
2. **Create flexible navigation bars**
3. **Center content easily**
4. **Distribute space evenly**
5. **Build components** (buttons, cards, etc.)

## When to Use CSS Grid

Use CSS Grid when you need to:

1. **Create complex page layouts**
2. **Work with both rows and columns**
3. **Build responsive designs** without media queries
4. **Overlap elements** precisely
5. **Create magazine-style layouts**

## Can You Use Both Together?

Absolutely! Grid and Flexbox work great together:

- Use **Grid for the overall page layout**
- Use **Flexbox for component-level layouts**

```css
.page-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "header header"
    "sidebar main"
    "footer footer";
}

.navigation {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## Conclusion

Both CSS Grid and Flexbox are essential tools in modern web development. Understanding their strengths helps you choose the right tool for each layout challenge.
